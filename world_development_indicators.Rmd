Each year, the World Bank compiles a collection of development indicators. This data contains thousands of annual indicators like access to electricity, primary and secondary education, etc.

In this project, we will analyze how much do different countries spend on education as a %age of their GDP.

This project is divided into the following tasks:
1. Download the dataset. Read the dataset into R
3. Get the feature we are interested in (education as a %age of their GDP)
4. Plotting that data for the year 2019.
```{r}

library(ggplot2)
```
